<h4 id="i-classfas-faquestioncircle-fafwi-is-there-a-registration-fee"><i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> Is there a registration fee?</h4>

<p>No, there is no registration fee. However note that the event takes significant
resources to run. So, if you sign up, we expect that you show up! If your plans
change, <a href="mailto:mcetinka@ed.ac.uk">let us know</a> ASAP so we can make your spot
available to someone else.</p>

<h4 id="i-classfas-faquestioncircle-fafwi-who-is-eligible-to-competeh4"><i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> Who is eligible to compete?</h4></h4>

<p>All University of Edinburgh undergraduate students are eligible. Note that we
only have space for 100 students, so act fast to sign up!</p>

<h4 id="i-classfas-faquestioncircle-fafwi-what-about-msc-and-phd-students"><i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> What about MSc and PhD students?</h4>

<p>We would love to have MSc and PhD students get involved as consultants during
the event.</p>

<h4 id="i-classfas-faquestioncircle-fafwi-how-large-are-the-teams"><i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> How large are the teams?</h4>

<p>Teams can be made up of 2-5 students, but teams of 4-5 students will be given
priority.</p>

<h4 id="i-classfas-faquestioncircle-fafwi-do-i-have-to-compete-in-a-team"><i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> Do I have to compete in a team?</h4>

<p>Yes, but if you don't have a team in mind, leave us your info and we'll match you
with others in the same boat.</p>

<h4 id="i-classfas-faquestioncircle-fafwi-what-do-i-need-to-compete"><i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> What do I need to compete?</h4>

<p>All you need is a laptop with tools for data analysis (there is no limitation on
which software you use) and enthusiasm for data. See <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/library-museum-gallery/using-library/borrowing-a-book/borrowing-laptops">here</a> for information on the university's laptop loan service. You can borrow one for the event from the library!</p>

<h4 id="i-classfas-faquestioncircle-fafwi-what-are-the-rules-of-the-competition"><i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> What are the rules of the competition?</h4>

<p>The rules are very simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>No more than five students per team.</li>
<li>No fewer than 2 students per team.</li>
<li>Team members can come and go as they please but all work has to be done on-site. A steady supply of food, beverage, and candy make it more inviting to stay.</li>
<li>It's a competition, but a friendly one, so collaboration between teams is not only allowed but highly encouraged. Official ASA DataFest<sup><small>TM</small></sup> consultants (grad students, faculty, data professionals, etc.) will also be around throughout the weekend to help with any questions you might have. However you can't have outside help.
