<h4 id="2021---rocky-mountain-poison-and-drug-safety-center">2021 - Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Safety Center</h4>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> For this competition the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Safety Center was interested in discovering and identifying patterns of drug use, with particular attention paid to identifying misuse. These could include patterns that might describe demographic profiles within a given category of drug or combinations of drugs that frequently appear together. One goal they were keen to achieve with the data was to predict future drug misuse cases. The data sets came from participants who responded to an on-line request and were paid to participate.

<h4 id="2020---covid-19">2020 - COVID-19</h4>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> For this competition, we challenged participants to explore the societal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic other than its direct health outcomes. Participants were allowed to explore everything from the effects on pollution levels, transportation levels, or working from home. They could investigate changes in the number of people posting on TikTok with their families or do an analysis on online education. We left the focus up to them and urged them to be thoughtful and creative as they analyzed data and communicated their insights about some of pandemic&rsquo;s impacts on society.
