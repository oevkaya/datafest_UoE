#### <i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> What do I need to compete?

All you need is a laptop with tools for data analysis (there is no limitation on 
which software you use) and enthusiasm for data. 

See [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/library-museum-gallery/using-library/borrowing-a-book/borrowing-laptops) for information on the university's laptop loan service. You can borrow one for the event from the library!

#### <i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> What are the rules of the competition?

- All projects must be submitted by **March 24, 2020 at 16:00 UK time**. There is only one submission per team. 
- The data used in the project must be publicly available or openly licensed.
- All interactive dashboards must be deployed online.
- All slide decks and write ups must be submitted as a PDF document.
- It's a competition, but a friendly one, so collaboration between teams is not only allowed but highly encouraged.

---

#### <i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> How do I submit my analysis? 

Submission will be done during the event and instructions will be given.  

---

#### <i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> What will I submit?

There should only be one submission per team. Each team will have 6 minutes to present their findings to the judges. That’s exactly 6 minutes, not 6 minutes and a few additional seconds, but it’s perfectly fine if your presentation is shorter. All team members should take part in preparing and/or presenting your final work. You can use a slide deck of your choice and submit it as a pdf.

Along with your presentation you will also turn in a one-page write-up of your project. You can think about this as the text of your presentation. The judges will refer to these during deliberation.

---

#### <i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> Where can I get help during the competition? 

Consultants will be available in the room during the event to talk to you about the data, your approach and methods, and your results.

We will also use MS Teams for communication during the competition.
