#### How do I sign up?

Click <a href="/signup">here</a> to sign up. Please fill out the form fully. You can sign up as a 4-5 (gets priority) or 2-3 person team or leave us your information to be matched with others looking for teams. Seats are limited, so register early! The registration deadline is **Monday, March 26, at midnight**.

#### Is there a registration fee?

There is a nominal registration fee of $20, but you can apply for a registration grant. To do so, simply check the appropriate box on the registration form. These will be approved on a rolling basis, and you will find out within a few days of applying.

#### Who is eligible to compete?</h4>

All University of Edinburgh undergraduate students are eligible. Note that we only have space for 100 students, so act fast to sign up!

#### What about MSc and PhD students?

We would love to have MSc and PhD students get involved as consultants during the event.

#### How large are the teams?

Teams can be made up of 2-5 students.

#### Do I have to compete in a team?

Yes, but if you don't have a team in mind, leave us your info and we'll match you with others in the same boat.

#### What do I need to compete?</h4>

All you need is a laptop with tools for data analysis (there is no limitation on which software you use) and enthusiasm for data.

#### What are the rules of the competition?</h4>

The rules are very simple:

  + No more than five students per team.
  + No fewer than 2 students per team.
  + Team members can come and go as they please but all work has to be done on-site. A steady supply of food, beverage, and candy make it more inviting to stay.
  + It's a competition, but a friendly one, so collaboration between teams is not only allowed but highly encouraged. Official ASA DataFest<sup><small>TM</small></sup> consultants (grad students, faculty, data professionals, etc.) will also be around throughout the weekend to help with any questions you might have. However you can't have outside help.
  
#### Do we have to stay the entire time?

No. You may come and go as you please. However, you are not allowed to work on the project except while you are on ASA DataFest<sup><small>TM</small></sup> grounds, and at least 3 members of your team must attend the introduction.

#### What can I win?

ASA student memberships, medals, books, fame, glory, or some combination thereof... And you get a t-shirt!

#### Where else is ASA DataFest<sup><small>TM</small></sup> happening?</h4>
